1. Open Terminal.app 
2. Copy/Paste the following command and press enter:
    cd ~/Downloads/BewareTheBasilisk-main
3. Type "make" and press enter to build the program 
4. Type "make run" and press enter to play!

NOTE: Step 3 only needs to be performed once, as the program 
      will remain built unless explicitly removed. If 
      program IS already built. You will receive message 
      similar to:
   		      "make: `BewareTheBasilisk-main' is up to date."
